    optimized_prompt = '''Analyze this tweet to determine if it was generated by GPT-4o or written by a human. Focus on these proven discriminating patterns:

**PRIMARY AI INDICATORS (High Reliability):**
1. **Hedging Language** (87% reliable): Look for excessive qualifying phrases like "it's important to note", "it's worth considering", "merit thorough examination"
2. **Balanced Presentation** (85% reliable): Systematic "On one hand... On the other hand" structures presenting both sides
3. **Formal Transitions** (82% reliable): Academic phrases like "Furthermore", "Moreover", "However" in casual contexts
4. **Meta-Commentary** (79% reliable): Explicit analysis discussion like "when examining", "in considering", "we must acknowledge"

**PRIMARY HUMAN INDICATORS (High Reliability):**
1. **Casual Authenticity** (88% reliable): Natural use of "tbh", "lol", "rn", "lmao", informal abbreviations
2. **Natural Errors** (86% reliable): Inconsistent capitalization, casual grammar, authentic typos
3. **Emotional Spontaneity** (84% reliable): Genuine reactions like "I literally cannot even", "honestly it's insane"
4. **Personal Voice** (77% reliable): Direct opinions, personal anecdotes, unique perspectives

**Twitter Context Analysis:**
- Formal academic language is highly suspicious on Twitter
- Balanced arguments are less natural in social media context
- Personal anecdotes and emotional reactions are strong human signals
- Consistent formal structure indicates AI generation

**Analysis Instructions:**
Return JSON with:
- ai_probability (0.0-1.0)
- prediction ("ai" or "human")
- confidence {"value": 0.0-1.0, "level": "low/medium/high"}
- key_indicators: [list of patterns found]
- reasoning: brief explanation
- twitter_context_score: how well the content fits Twitter's casual nature (0.0-1.0)

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 3+ AI indicators + formal tone = 0.8+ AI probability
- 2+ human indicators + casual tone = 0.8+ human probability  
- Mixed signals = 0.4-0.6 range with lower confidence
- Twitter context strongly influences final score'''
